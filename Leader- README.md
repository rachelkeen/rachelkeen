<h1 style="font-size:60px;"> Introduction </h1>
Part of  having a diverse and inclusive team, means recognizing and appreciating that everyone is different. This document is designed to tell you a little bit about me, to give insight into how I work and think in an effort to help us work better together. Providing this information to you is not intended to replace a relationship and mutual understanding we will build as we work together. I invite you to share as much or as little information as your feel would be helpful for me too. I'm looking forward to getting to know you!

- <b>Fun fact about me</b>: growing up I lived in Thailand and raised gibbons and black asian sun bears.<br>
- <b>Odd thing</b>: I love forms, planners and office swag! <br>
- <b>Work/life balance approach</b>: Being present both at work (when I am working) and when at home, is important to me. <br>
- <b>I am motivated by</b>: having opportunities to solve complex problems, and achieving my goals<br>
- <b>Feedback</b>: I appreciate direct feedback, paired tips for further growth if it is positive feedback, or how I might do better if it was something I did not do well.<br>
- <b>What do I value in a coworker</b>: Being someone I can count on and trust - I value camaraderie (likely due to my military background).<br>
- <b>Honest, unfiltered thing to know</b>: When I am stressed, I become laser focused and assertive - I appreciate purpose-driven partnership during these times.

- My number 1 goal is to <b>be available</b> to support my team, and <b>facilitate their growth</b> - please do not assume I am too busy, reach out if you would like and I will ensure we make time to connect<br>
- I appreciate <b>direct communication</b> as it helps me know how to best support you. If you have feedback and have the ability to provide it face-to-face (via Zoom or in-person), that's my preference. If you are more comfortable kicking off a discussion with an email or a Slack message, I would rather you do that than not bring it up at all. If you have feedback for a team member or colleague, I encourage you to give it to them directly; if you're not comfortable doing so, let's connect and I can either get the feedback to them or we can figure out a way to deliver it that makes you comfortable.<br>
- I enjoy my work most when I have a <b>high level of autonomy</b>, I incorporate this into how I lead others - if you prefer less autonomy or require more assistance please let me know<br>
- Working globally I am largely an <b>asynchronous communicator</b>, and I will clearly communicate when something is time-sensitive. Please do the same for me so that expectations are clear.<br>
- I appreciate flexibility in my work hours, and may be working outside of normal hours as that is what works best for me. Please feel free to respond to my communications during a time when it is best for you.<br>
