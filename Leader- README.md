# Introduction
Part of  having a diverse and inclusive team, means recognizing and appreciating that everyone is different. This document is designed to tell you a little bit about me, to give insight into how I work and think in an effort to help us work better together. Providing this information to you is not intended to replace a relationship and mutual understanding we will build as we work together. I invite you to share as much or as little information as your feel would be helpful for me too. I'm looking forward to getting to know you!
