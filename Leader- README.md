<h1 style="font-size:60px;"> Introduction </h1>
Part of  having a diverse and inclusive team, means recognizing and appreciating that everyone is different. This document is designed to tell you a little bit about me, give insight into how I work and think in an effort to help us work better together. Providing this information to you is not intended to replace a relationship and mutual understanding we will build as we work together. I invite you to share as much or as little information as your feel would be helpful for me too. I'm looking forward to getting to know you!

<b>Planning hours</b> 7:30-8:30a
<b>Working hours</b> are generally 8:30a-5p, though this varies somewhat depending on meetings. If I am not available during my normal hours for some reason, I will mark it in my Slack status (and on my calendar).<br>

<p>
- My number 1 goal is to <b>be available</b> to support my team, and <b>facilitate their growth</b> - please do not assume I am too busy, reach out if you would like and I will ensure we make time to connect<br>
- I appreciate <b>direct communication</b> as it helps me know how to best support you<br>
- I enjoy my work most when I have a <b>high level of autonomy</b>, I incorporate this into how I lead others - if you prefer less autonomy or require more assistance please let me know<br>
- Working globally I am largely an <b>asynchronous communicator</b>, and I will clearly communicate when something is time-sensitive. Please do the same for me so that expectations are clear.<br>
- I appreciate flexibility in my work hours, and may do some of my outside of normal working hours as that is what works best for me. Please feel free to respond to my communications during a time when it is best for you.<br>
  ### After-hours communication

I will get a sense of your normal working hours as we begin working together, and I will make a strong effort not to message you outside of these hours because I know many people have Slack notifications sent to their phone. I will sometimes send emails outside of your working hours (especially if we're in different time zones), as emails don't tend to notify people quite as intrusively; do not feel obligated to respond until you are working. With Slack I tend to use the "schedule message" functionality if I am sending a message outside of your usual working times, since it tends to trigger a notification. If you are receiving after-hours Slack messages from me with any frequency, please let me knowâ€”it may mean I'm misunderstanding the hours you normally work.
  <br>
If for any reason I do urgently need you outside of your normal working hours, I will text you. This will happen _extremely_ rarely (if ever).
<br>
Similarly, if you email or Slack me outside of my working hours, I may not respond quickly. I do try to keep up with notifications in case there's anything urgent, but if I read a message and it's non-urgent, I may leave it until the next working day. If you have something non-urgent you want to tell me and it's outside of my work hours, I don't mind if you Slack me, though I always appreciate an explicit note that it's non-urgent! If you need me urgently outside of work hours, paging me is the best way to get hold of me, though you can always try Slack too first.
<p>  
### One-on-ones (Direct Reports)

I will put thirty minutes on your calendar each week for a one-on-one. If you need more time, let me know and I will adjust. 
<br>
One-on-ones are _your time_. I will probably have some things to discuss with you, but this is first and foremost your opportunity to let me know how you're doing, what you need, what you wish could be different, how you feel about our team and your teammates, what your career goals are... etc. These are for the conversations you might not necessarily have with me when we're sitting at our desks amongst coworkers. If you'd like to give me a brief status update on things you're working on or that you're stuck on, that is fine with me, but those are generally better-suited to a quick chat while I'm at my desk, a Slack message, or a separate meeting.
<br>
I encourage you to write down some things throughout the week that you want to chat about if you think that will help, since it can sometimes be hard to think of or bring up things in the moment. If you have things you want to talk about but struggle with bringing them up, feel free to send me a vague agenda ahead of time. If you don't know what to talk about, say so. We can use that as a topic.
<br>

### Performance

I will give you feedback on how you're doing continuously, including in our one-on-ones. If I'm worried about your performance, I will let you know. My goal is for you to never be unsure about how you're performing (and how I think you're performing). If you ever feel unsure about either of these things, please let me know.

## If you need something

1.  Slack me or set up an impromptu Zoom meeting.
2.  Throw something on my calendar. If I am scheduled for an interview or something else I can't reschedule and you invite me to a meeting, I will propose another time. 

Though I work remotely, please expect me to be as available as I would be if we were in the office. Do not hesitate to schedule a brief Zoom meeting when you'd normally just swing by my desk for five minutes, please do so without hesitation if you think chatting face-to-face or screen-sharing will be more useful than textual communication.

## Side note
I created this document in an effort to help take some of guesswork out of things. If there is something I should consider adding, or if you have a question taht is not covered in this document bring it up to me in one-on-one or over Slack.
